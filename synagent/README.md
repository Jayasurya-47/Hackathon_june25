# 🧪 LLM-Based Retrosynthesis Agent with Biocatalysis

An intelligent retrosynthesis planner built with LangGraph + LLMs, integrating biocatalysis, enzyme reasoning, and patent search to enable explainable and scalable synthesis planning.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ LLM-guided retrosynthetic planning (from name or SMILES)
- 🔬 Biocatalytic reaction prediction (RetroBioCat)
- 🧬 EC number + enzyme prediction with FASTA retrieval
- 🧠 Atom mapping + reaction condition inference
- 📄 Similar patent search with LLM-based similarity reasoning
- 🧾 Summary generation in YAML/Markdown
- 🔗 Future: AlphaFold/Boltz integration for structure validation

---

## 📦 Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/boltzmannlabs/Hackathon_june25.git
